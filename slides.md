# DevOps

> DevOps is Developers and Operations working together
  for the good of the business

# DevOps

* A bit like Agile in that it extends the Definition
  of Done

# A little bit of history
* late 2009 - [DevOps is coined and DevOpsDays born](https://blog.newrelic.com/2014/05/16/devops-name/)
* 2010 - [Continuous Delivery](http://continuousdelivery.com) published

<aside class="notes">
DevOps was coined when Agile Systems Infrastructure was too long
</aside>

# This is all obvious, right?

* It definitely wasn't to a lot of us at the time
* Misaligned incentives held us back

<aside class="notes">
Developers are incentivized to deliver
features (bonuses and sense of achievement)
Operations are incentivized to maintain
availability (bonuses and being paged)
</aside>

# CAMS

- Culture
- Automation
- Measurement
- Sharing

<aside class="notes">
culture: trust, collaboration, continuous improvement
automation: ability to provision and deploy without manual
  steps
measurement: knowing what the business goals are and whether
  your improvemts are adding business value
sharing: accountability, using the same source control, 
  the same automation, the same measuring systems
</aside>

# What have we done

* Completely open automation
* Developers contributing to automation
* Repeatable provisioning and deployment
* Coding standards for automation

# Where would we like to go

* Automated testing of automation (turtles all the way down)
* Developers pushing to production ( == Developers oncall)
* Complete self-service

Addresses most of the criticisms levelled at DevOps in the past six years,
although some of it is now out of date. DevOps certification is now a thing,
sadly.
