# DevOps

> DevOps is Developers and Operations working together
  for the good of the business

# DevOps

* A bit like Agile in that it extends the Definition
  of Done

# A little bit of history

* 10 deploys a day!
* DevOps is coined

# This is all obvious, right?

* Misaligned incentives held us back

{%aside%}
Developers are incentivized to deliver
features (bonuses and sense of achievement)
Operations are incentivized to maintain
availability (bonuses and being paged)
{%aside%}

# Is DevOps just Continuous Delivery?

{% aside %}
* Continuous Delivery relies on DevOps.
  You'll struggle to attain it without
  the other key elements...
{% aside %}

# CAMS

- Culture
- Automation
- Measurement
- Sharing

{% aside %}
culture: trust, collaboration, continuous improvemtn
automation: ability to provision and deploy without manual
  steps
measurement: knowing what the business goals are and whether
  your improvemts are adding business value
sharing: using the same source control, the same automation,
  the same measuring systems and the same targets
{% aside %}

# What have we done

* Completely open automation
* Developers contributing to automation

# What isn't DevOps

* NoOps
* Panacea
